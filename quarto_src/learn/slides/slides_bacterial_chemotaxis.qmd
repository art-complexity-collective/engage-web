Consider a simple bacterial cell moving around on a petri plate. 

The cell has a heading and always moves in the direction it points.

Once in a while, it "tumbles", changing its heading to a random direction. 

::: {style="font-size: 80%"}
*Increasing the **rate of tumbling** ($\gamma$) increases the frequency of tumbling events, decreasing the time over which the cell moves uninterrupted in a direction.*

### 2
The experimenter decides to add a food source to the plate, say in the form of a piece of paper soaked in sucrose. 

::: {style="font-size: 80%"}
*Add a source of food by clicking anywhere. Clicking multiple times in the same place increases the concetration further*
:::

This source of food diffuses into the media, creating a continuous concentration field throughout the plate.

A *naive* bacterial cell (brown) that does not sense this concentration field wanders around aimlessly, without localizing on the source, even if the tumble rate is changed.

### 3
Now, the experimenter decides to see what a slightly more intelligent bacterium (blue cell) does in this situation.

Unlike the naive cell, this cell can *sense* the amount of sucrose surrounding it. 

It subsequently regulates its rate of tumbling ($\gamma$) based on the concentrations as,

$$ 
\gamma =\frac{1}{2}e^{-\Delta_{\text{food}}}
$$

Where $\Delta_{\text{food}}$ is the difference in the concentration of food the smart cell encounters within a small time. 

::: {style="font-size: 80%"}
*Draw some food sources to see what the naive and smart bacterial cells do.*
:::

A better way to observe the difference is to look at multiple cells of these two types and see what they do as a group.

::: {style="font-size: 80%"}
*Use the buttons to add some naive and smart cells and observe whether they are able to find the food soruce. You can add more food sources by clicking on the canvas if you wish.*
